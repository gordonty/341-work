<h3>How I did this weeks homework</h3>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>It took me all week to read through everything and to make sure that I did the {TO DO:} sections.</li>
  <li>I then sat down on saturday to actually make the html document and get it pushed to my repository.</li>
  <li>I decided to make my questionare about reading because I love to read.</li>
  <li>I looked at the homework example that was provided for us so I could get an idea of what I needed to do.</li>
  <li>I then sat down to create the questionare</li>
  <li>I needed to go find some pictures which took some time.</li>
  <li>I then pushed it all to my repository then took a look to see how it looked.</li>
  <li>Some small adjustments needed to be made which I did.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Some Problems</h3>
<ul>
    <li>My biggest problem was the pictures. For some reason they wouldn't load on the website.</li>
    <li>I had the pictures saved in my files correctly, I had the tags in my markdown written correctly, and I pushed them to my repository on GitHub.</li>
    <li>Did some searching to see what the problem was and it turns out for some reason my repository could not find the picture files.</li>
    <li> I deleted the pictures and found some new ones which I put into the html document and then pushed to my repository. Then I looked to see if they loaded on the webpage.</li>
    <li>Two of the three new pictures loaded but one picture file still wasn't being found, so I found another picture and tried it.</li>
    <li>I finally got all the picutres up and loaded and working correctly.</li>
    <li>I did have a problem with my drop down box for some reason.</li>
    <li> I couldn't figure it out and it took me a few minutes but I then noticed I didn't finish/close the select tag.</li>
    <li>Got that fixed and took a final look. Every looked good.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What I learned.</h6>
<p>Making a form or making a webpage interactive has a lot of different parts to it. What parts you use depends on how you want it to look and what kind of interactions are going to be available. Some parts of a form are similar such as the checkboxes and radio buttons. The difference between these two are that checkboxes you can select more then one while radio buttons only allow you to select a single thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes you run into problems that take some time to fix. You need to check your work and make sure you have everything built correctly because sometimes that is where your problem(s) is occuring. When things get hard, keep going and you'll eventually figure it out.</p>
