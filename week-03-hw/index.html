<h1>I Opened a Book<h1/>
  <h2>by Julia Donaldson
<p>
      I opened a book and in I strode.<br>
      Now nobody can find me.<br>
      I've left my chair, my house, my road,<br>
      My town and my world behind me.<br>
      <br>
      I'm wearing the cloak, I've slipped on the ring,<br>
      I've swallowed the magic potion.<br>
      I've fought with a dragon, dined with a king<br>
      And dived in a bottomless ocean.<br>
      <br>
      I opened a book and made some friends.<br>
      I shared their tears and laughter<br>
      And followed their road with its bumps and bends<br>
      To the happily ever after.<br>
      <br>
      I finished my book and out I came.<br>
      The cloak can no longer hide me.<br>
      My chair and my house are just the same,<br>
      But I have a book inside me.<br>
