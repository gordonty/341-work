    <br />
    <h4 class="head-4"> February 16 1875</h4>
      <p class="par"> We have been in the
        <div class="hover">valley of the kings</div>
         for several months and today we found a tomb entrance. We have been working all day to clear it. We will be opening the tomb tomorrow. I am excited to discover what lies inside but for now I must rest.</p>
      <br />

    <h4 class="head-4"> February 17 1875</h4>
      <p class="par"> We opened the tomb today. A sarcophagus was placed in the middle of the room. No other artifacts were found. It is possible that the tomb was pillaged by grave robbers but no other entry point was found. I have a <em>bad</em> feeling about this sarcophagus. We will be opening the sarcophagus tomorrow and I am <em>scared</em> to see what might be waiting for us inside.</p>

    <h4 class="head-4"> February 18 1875</h4>
      <p class="par"> The sarcophagus was all but <strong>empty</strong>. A single piece of papyrus was found inside with an <span style="color:#1034A6">egyptian blue</span> jewel. No one in camp can read the papyrus so we must wait for a translator to come from Cairo. My bad feeling is persisting and I am starting to worry.</p>

    <h4 class="head-4"> February 19 1875</h4>
      <p class="par"> The translator arrived this afternoon. I wish we hadn't come here. I wish I had stayed back in New York. The papyrus said cursed be the one who touches the jewel. May ghosts of the past plague the soul. May death come early and be painful. My bad feeling is still persisting and growing.
    <br />
    <h4 class="head-4"> February 20 1875</h4>
      <p class="par">Strange things have started happening around camp and many of our expedition have fallen ill with no explanation. I myself am starting to feel ill and feel as if someone is whispering in my ear. May God protect us all.</p>
    <br />

    <h4 class="head-4"> February 21 1875</h4>
      <p> Very few of us are left many died overnight. I am starting to see my dead fianc√© Mary around camp. I am hoping it is the fever and not that curse. I am so tired. I must sleep.</p>
    <br />

    <h4 class="head-4"> February 28 1875</h4>
      <p>I can still hear the screaming. Mary will not leave me be and others have joined her. Why am I seeing the deceased.</p>
    <br />

    <h4 class="head-4"> February 30 1875</h4>
      <p> Sering pain consumes me. There is no one left. The camp is empty. I do not expect to make it through the night. Mary have you come to take me with you? Wait... Mary what... Please don't....</p>
