<h3>Problems</h3>
  <p> I created and put together my index.html and after I was done I went online to see how it looked. Nothing was showing up on the page. I created an issue in the class github page. One of my class mates noticed that in my header for the closing tag of the title I had put </tittle> instead of </title>. I fixed that and I was able to view the webpage.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I had some problems getting the css to work. I didn't know how to create a style.css and could not find any examplea on how it should look. I went back and looked at the lecture content and noticed that in the html there were classes and in the css it was written differently. I added classes in the html then re-wrote the css and that woked. My css stated to show on my web page.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I had some problems getting the first-letter and hover elements to work the way that I wanted. I wasn't too worried about it as I am/was out of town and didn't want to worry about homework.</p>

<h3>What I learned</h3>
  <Ul>
    <li>You can make your web page more interesting and exciting with one simple file.</li>
    <li>The color picker for atom is pretty cool and makes putting different colors into your page pretty easy.</li>
    <li>I really shouldn't work on homework so late at night that way I don't miss simple things such as misspellings and so I actually remember the examples from the lecture content.</li>
  </ul>

<h3> Why I did what I did</h3>
  <p>I am not a very good writer so I decided to do a short story in the style of journal entries from an archeologist. I started typing and thought it turned out pretty well, not the best but alright.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>The story being journal entries and being set in the desert I decided to chose brown for my main color. It adds to the story and still alows for fairly easy reading of the text. The colors of the headings I used color picker to find something that was close to the brown background color but not the same color which resulted in the colors you find on my web page.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>For the text elements I put a few in there so I could use them and see what they did. I tried to use them so that they added to the story and I hope that they do by emphasising feelings, words, pictures, etc....</p>
