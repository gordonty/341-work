<h3>Problems</h3>
  <p> I created and put together my index.html and after I was done I went online to see how it looked. Nothing was showing up on the page. I created an issue in the class github page. One of my class mates noticed that in my header for the closing tag of the title I had put </tittle> instead of </title>. I fixed that and I was able to view the webpage.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I had some problems getting the css to work. I didn't know how to create a style.css and could not find any examplea on how it should look.</p>
