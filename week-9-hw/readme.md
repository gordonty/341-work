<h3>Learning</h3>
  <p>You can place different pieces of information on different parts of the page in their own box.</p>
  <p>I figured out how you get the nice header with links to the home page and other pages in the website</p>

<h3>What I did</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I created the index.html</li>
      <li>I created the header.css</li>
        <ul>
          <li>fought with it to figure out how to get it to work</li>
          <li>couldn't get the dropdown menu to work</li>
            <ul>
              <li>more on this in the problem section</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<h3>Problems</h3>
  <p>I couldn't get the dropdown header to work. I looked at the lecture material and several examples. I tweaked my header.css to see if I could get it to work and I couldn't. I did create an issue on the class github but at the time of writing this on saturday night no one had tried to help me out.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I also couldn't get my aside float box to work the way I wanted it to. I wanted it to be aside my other boxes but all I could get it to do was go under the other boxes. I looked at the lectures and at examples and still couldn't figure it out.<p>

<h3>Frustration</h3>
<p>I don't like css. I always have problems with one or two of the particular css properties. Being a distance learner student I don't have anyone who I can go to and say "can you look at this and help me out". I don't have the time to sit all day trying to figure out how to get the properties to work and it's very frustrating when I feel that I have done everything and it's still not working. If anyone has any suggestions I would like to hear.</p>
