<h3>Learning</h3>
  <p>I was surprised how easy creating a parallex site was. Now I know how individuals get their websites/pages to have that moving affect. Thats kind of all I learned this week.</p>

<br />

<h3>Process</h3>
  <p>I read through the lecture material and looked at examples during the week. Friday I thought about what I wanted to do for my page. I then sat down on Saturday to put my page together. Before my problems putting the page together didn't take that long.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>When I first looked at my page to make sure it looked how I wanted it to look there was no style to it. I then remembered I didn't link the style.css to my index.html so I went back and did that. Problem solved.</li>
    <li>My images weren't showing up on my page. I looked at the class issues on github to see if anyone had, had that problem already. Someone did and someone else had already posted a suggestion of putting the imgs directory into the css directory. I did that with my repo and then checked my webpage again. Images were there. Problem fixed... or so I thought.</li>
    <li>I noticed that my text color against the background colors were making it very hard to read the text. I went into my css and changed that. I then went to the webpage to see if the new color made the text easier to read. It did but my images were gone again.</li>
    <li>No images again. I checked the css to make sure I didn't move, delete, or add something someplace it wasn't supposed to be but couldn't find anything. I had another class mate look at my code to see if he could find anything. He suggested that I move my img-# group infomation below the individual img-# information. I tried that but it didn't do anything. I then e-mailed Nick Moles to see if he could help me out. At the time of writing this on Saturday after noon he had not yet replied.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Images update. Nick Moles got back to me. He stated that the images were working when he tested the webpage. I guess my computer just needs a break.</p>
