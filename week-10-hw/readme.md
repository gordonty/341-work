<h3>What I learned</h3>
  <p>I learned what Responsive web design is and why it's a good idea to use it. I also learned that there is a lot that goes into making a webpage look nice not only on just a computer but across several different devices.</p>

  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p>I still couldn't get the dropdown menu to work. I also couldn't get some of the smaller style to work with the larger style. The text is right up against the edges of the box which I dodn't like but if I changed the style to fix that the flex box style would change to something I didn't like. I couldn't figure out how to get issues such as these to work together. For the most part however I got the webpage to look pretty close to how I wanted it to (see below picture of sketch plan).</p>
