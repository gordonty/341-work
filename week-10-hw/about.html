  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a student working on my anthropology degree. I thought I would take a web development class because it sounded like it would be interesting. I like to read and watch movies. I also probably spend too much time on the internet.<p>

  <h3>Why a webpage about responsive web design</h3>
    <p>Honestly it was a class assignment but I hope that it might help other understand a little bit about responsive web design. I didn't really know what it was but I learned as I put this page together.</p>
