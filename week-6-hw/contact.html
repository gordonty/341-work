  <p>Your local library has a selection of books and genres to choose from. They also have magazines, movies, music, audio books, and computers for public use. Most libraries have programs or activities for the community which is great for those summer months. The librarians are there to help you so don't be vervous asking them for help.</p>
  <p>I remember going to the library often when I was in elementary school. I would leave with a stack of Nancy Drew books as big as I was. Your local library is a great place to spend an afternoon with your kiddos so why don't you head over there the next chance you get.</p>
