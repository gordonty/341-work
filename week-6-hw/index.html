  <p>A good imagination helps fend off boredom. In order for an imagination to flourish you need to feed it and you can do that by reading. Read whenever you can and read as much as you can. Your local library is a good place to start your adventure but there are also websites such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com"> goodreads.com</a> that support reading and can help kickstart your adventure.</p>
