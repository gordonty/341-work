  <em><strong>BIG</strong></em>, <em><strong>BIG</strong></em>, <em><strong>BIG</strong></em> Problems
</h3>
<br/>
<h6>Saturday</h6>
<p>I ran into some problems when I tried to add my video for hosted_video.html. First things wouldn't commit. I figured out how to fix that problem and no I don't remember how. Then GitHub Desktop wouldn't sync/push to GitHub. By this time it was getting late. I would get an error message with something about my repo having a bug. I looked online to see what I could do to fix that. I ended up deleting all my files in my repo. Thankfully I was able to find them in my recycling bin and restore them. About midnight I gave up for the night and whent to bed. I did however e-mail Nick Moles before bed to let him know what was up.</p>
<h6>Sunday</h6>
<p>After church I spoke with someone who works in an IT department to see what I could do to possibly fix my problems. After I got home I decided to uninstall GitHub Desktop and then reinstall it. That seemed to work as I was able to commit and push my contact.html and questions.html.</p>
<p>When I tried to commit and push my video file for my hosted_video.html again I got the error message that by repo had a bug. I remembered that at somepoint between all my crying and frustrated fits Saturday night I saw that I could be getting that message because a file was too big. So I looked to see what I could do to compress the video file. I tried Git Large File Storage and it didn't work.</p>
<p>It was about 11:30pm when I decided to stop trying for the night as I knew it was going to take me about 30min to get ready for bed. I sent a message to Stephen Round to see if he had any idea on how I could compress my video file before I went to head to bed. I told myself I was going to try one last time Monday. Again I e-mailed Nick Moles at some point during the crazy.</p>
<h6>Monday afternoon<h6>
<p>Stephen Round messaged me back Monday morning saying to use a video editor to compress my video file. When I got home Monday afternoon I tried several different video editors and a few different video file types. Nothing was working no matter what I seemed to do. About 5:30ish pm I decided to give up and write this readme as I have a good amount of other homework to do and my grade is pretty good in this class.</P>
<p>I came to the conclusion that hosting a video is really frustrating and that I will not be hosting videos. I will use embeded videos if I ever decide to use videos in any web pages I create but I will most likely never use videos.</p>
